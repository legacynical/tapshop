## Windows — AutoHotkey v2

### Running with AHK Installation

1. Install [AutoHotkey v2.0](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2. Run the `TAPSHOP.ahk` script

### Running without AHK Installation

1. Download [latest GYTP release](https://github.com/legacynical/global-yt-playback/releases)
2. Run the `GYTP.exe` (right-click in system tray for AHK related settings/options, `` Ctrl + Win + ` `` for GUI)

> [!TIP]
> - Place script ahk/exe (or shortcut) in `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup` to autorun on startup.
> - Applications running at admin level will ignore script functions, which can be fixed by also running the script ahk/exe as admin or setting its advanced properties to run as administrator.

While this project's scripts are provided under the MIT license, please note that the AHK interpreter is under the [GPL-2.0 license](https://github.com/AutoHotkey/AutoHotkey?tab=GPL-2.0-1-ov-file). This applies to compiled builds (.exe) as it packages both the AHK script and the AHK interpreter. For most users or developers, this shouldn't be of concern as the GPL-2.0 license itself is also quite permissive.
